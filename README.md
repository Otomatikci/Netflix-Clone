# Netflix-Clone

This is my first web development project, a simple Netflix Clone. The project focuses on replicating the front-end design of Netflix using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Features
Responsive Design: Adjusts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap.
CSS Styling: Custom CSS for styling and layout.
Navigation Bar: A fully functional header with a search bar, links to different pages (Home, TV Shows, Movies, etc.).
Movie Thumbnails: Display of popular movies using grid layout and hover effects.
Technologies Used
HTML5 - For structuring the content.
CSS3 - For styling and layout design.

Future Improvements
Add JavaScript for movie sliders and dynamic content.
Include more pages for TV Shows, Movies, and User Profiles.
Improve the design for better accessibility.
